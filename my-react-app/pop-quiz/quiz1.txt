{after index1.js}

1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
A:
cuz the jsx syntax is defined in react

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A:
A javascript object.

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
A:
we need our JSX to be nexted in a single parent element

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
A:
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
to tell it HOW to do each step.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
A:
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.
